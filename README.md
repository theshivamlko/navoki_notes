## Getting Started

This project is made with [Flutter Framework](https://www.flutter.dev), [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/), [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) and [Adobe XD Flutter plugin](https://xd.adobelanding.com/xd-to-flutter/).

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Installation and Config
- Install [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) from official site.
- Setup Environment for [Android](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/flutter-for/android-devs) and [iOS](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/flutter-for/ios-devs)
- Setup Environment for [Web](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8YYVV1aZc8)
- Setup Environment for [Desktop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixj0MMusDM8)
- Create a [Firebase Project](https://firebase.google.com/) 
- Enable [Firebase Security rules](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/security/get-started) on Firebase Console. [Read more](https://medium.com/@khreniak/cloud-firestore-security-rules-basics-fac6b6bea18e).
- Check if platform is shows for project by running ```flutter devices```
- Replace [`API_KEY`](lib/utils/AppConstants.dart) value with your project key, `<Project>` _**-> Project Settings -> General ->**_ `Web API key
` 
## Build Project
- To run and build project run command `flutter build <device-name>`
- To get devices list, run `flutter devices`

### NOTE:
- Also, install build tools for each platforms  to run on that platform. Follow links above.
- **Flutter Desktop is not stable yet** so you might face some issue, till now I have faced few app crashes on desktop but feature is implemented and app is running.
For Linux app you need to build project and run using ```flutter run -d linux```

## Learning
Few things I have used that you can work to understand flutter development.
- Simple app state management
- Using RestAPI
- Firebase Auth and Cloud Firestore using Rest API
- Staggered View
- Local Storage

You can build your own project on this just by changing dart code in `lib` folder.
